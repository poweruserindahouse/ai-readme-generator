AI README Generator

This is a full-stack application that automatically generates professional README.md files for public GitHub repositories. It features a modern, dark-themed React frontend and a powerful Python FastAPI backend that leverages the OpenAI API.
High-Level Architecture

The application is composed of two main parts that work together:

    Frontend (UI): A sleek, single-page interface built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS. It provides a user-friendly experience for entering a GitHub URL, viewing loading states, handling errors, and displaying the final generated README.

    Backend (API): A high-performance API built with FastAPI. It handles the core logic: cloning the repository, intelligently crawling the source code to exclude irrelevant files, and communicating with the OpenAI API to generate the documentation.

Features
Frontend

    Modern & Responsive UI: A clean, dark-themed interface that works seamlessly across all screen sizes.

    Real-time Input Validation: Ensures that users enter a structurally valid GitHub URL before making an API request.

    Clear State Indicators: Provides visual feedback with spinners and status messages during the generation process.

    Robust Error Handling: Displays clear, user-friendly alerts if the backend encounters an error.

    Convenient Output Management: Includes "Copy to Clipboard" and "Download .md" functionality for the generated content.

Backend

    Fast & Asynchronous: Built with FastAPI for high performance, capable of handling concurrent requests efficiently.

    Intelligent Code Crawling: The backend intelligently scans the repository, ignoring irrelevant files (e.g., node_modules, .git, large assets) and directories to build a clean and effective context for the AI.

    AI-Powered Content Generation: Leverages OpenAI's GPT models to create high-quality, human-like documentation.

    Secure API Key Management: Uses a .env file to securely manage the OpenAI API key, keeping it out of the source code.

Project Structure

The project consists of two main parts that you need to manage:

/
├── frontend/             # Contains all frontend-related files (e.g., index.html or React components)
└── backend/
    ├── main.py         # The complete backend API server
    ├── .env            # Your secret API key
    └── requirements.txt  # Backend dependencies

Installation & Setup

To run this project, you need to set up the backend. The frontend can be run as a simple HTML file or as a standard React project.
Backend Setup

    Navigate to the backend directory:

    cd backend

    Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

    # Create the environment
    python3 -m venv .venv

    # Activate it
    source .venv/bin/activate

    Install Dependencies:

    pip install "fastapi[all]" openai python-dotenv GitPython

    Configure API Key:

        Create a file named .env in the backend directory.

        Add your OpenAI API key to this file:

        OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YourSecretApiKeyHere"

How to Run the Application

You must run both the backend server and the frontend simultaneously.

    Start the Backend Server:

        Open a terminal and navigate to your backend project directory.

        Make sure your virtual environment is activated (source .venv/bin/activate).

        Run the following command:

        uvicorn main:app --reload

        Keep this terminal window open. The server will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

    Open the Frontend:

        If you have a single index.html file, open it directly in your web browser.

        If you have a standard React project, navigate to the frontend directory in a new terminal and run npm run dev.

Usage

    With the application open in your browser, enter the URL of any public GitHub repository into the input field.

    Click the "Generate README" button.

    The application will show a loading indicator while the backend clones the repo, analyzes the code, and generates the content.

    Once complete, the generated README will appear in the text area.

    You can then use the "Copy" or "Download" buttons to save the result.
